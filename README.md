# Systems Analysis and Design
### Systems Proposal Report

I worked in a team of 4 as a software analyst to create a project plan. The assignment was to create an internal Covid contact tracing app for a fictional university. 

In the report we:
- Go over our initial aims of the project.
- Review other contact tracing systems.
- Research which methodologies we might use (such as agile).
- Plan the projects scheduling and risk assessment.
- Gather the requirements (Functional and Non-Functional).
- Using an object-oriented approach use UML diagrams to design our app.
  - Use Case Diagram
  - Class Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram
- Design the database (With an ERD diagram) and UI.
